# Decision Support tool 

Multi-objective optimisation based decision tool

In any insect production cycle we have three different, conflicting objectives: maximizing economic viability, minimizing environmental impacts, and maximizing societal benefits. The state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithm NSGA-II  is used to obtain Pareto fronts of solutions, that are later analyzed to identify suitable trade-offs. 
Finally, there is a tool that is still in beta stages that will be capable to show what is the environmental impact of a certain scenario and, via recommendations from experts, advice on different decisions that should be taken to decrease the environmental impact of a given chain.
